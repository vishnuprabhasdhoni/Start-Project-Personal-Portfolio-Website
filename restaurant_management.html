    <h1>Restaurant Management System</h1>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <div class="project-details">
        <h4>About the Project</h4>
        <p>The Restaurant Management System (RMS) is a comprehensive solution built to streamline operations at a restaurant. Developed using Java, JavaFX, and MySQL, this system helps in managing core operations like table reservations, order management, billing, and inventory control. The goal was to reduce operational complexity and improve efficiency across the restaurant’s operations.</p>

        <h4>Key Features</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Order Management:</strong> The system tracks orders from the moment they are placed until they are completed, ensuring accuracy and improving processing speed. A significant reduction in order processing time by 30% has been achieved.</li>
            <li><strong>Table Reservations:</strong> The RMS allows customers to make table reservations, helping in optimizing seating arrangements and managing customer flow efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Billing:</strong> The system handles billing automatically by generating invoices based on the orders, with real-time price calculations and discounts.</li>
            <li><strong>Inventory Control:</strong> The system manages stock levels, tracks ingredient usage, and helps identify when to restock items, contributing to a 20% improvement in inventory management accuracy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Back-End Services</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Database Integration with MySQL:</strong> MySQL is used for managing the restaurant's data. The system interacts with the database using JDBC to store and retrieve information about customers, orders, and inventory.</li>
            <li><strong>RESTful APIs:</strong> RESTful APIs were designed to allow communication between different components of the system, providing a scalable and flexible way to integrate with other services, such as external payment gateways.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Logic:</strong> The business logic is encapsulated in service classes that handle operations such as managing orders, processing payments, and updating inventory levels.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Testing and Optimization</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unit Testing:</strong> JUnit was used for thorough testing of various system components to ensure they functioned correctly before deployment.</li>
            <li><strong>SQL Query Optimization:</strong> Complex SQL queries were optimized to reduce database load and improve performance, especially during peak hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Sales and Inventory Reports:</strong> The system generates detailed reports to assist in sales tracking and inventory management, providing insights that helped streamline operations and improve decision-making.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Achievements</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Operational Efficiency:</strong> The system has significantly reduced order processing time by 30%, improving overall restaurant efficiency and customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li><strong>Inventory Accuracy:</strong> A 20% improvement in inventory management accuracy has been achieved, reducing stockouts and overstocking problems.</li>
            <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> By implementing RESTful APIs and encapsulating the business logic in service classes, the system’s reliability and scalability have been greatly enhanced.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Technical Skills Used</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Java:</strong> Java was used for implementing core business logic and handling backend services.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaFX:</strong> JavaFX was utilized for the front-end interface, providing a rich user experience with smooth graphical elements.</li>
            <li><strong>MySQL:</strong> MySQL was used for database management, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval.</li>
        </ul>
