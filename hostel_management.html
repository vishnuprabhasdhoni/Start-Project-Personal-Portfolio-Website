    <h1>Hostel Management System</h1>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <div class="project-details">
        <h4>About the Project</h4>
        <p>The Hostel Management System is a comprehensive application designed to manage the operational aspects of hostel facilities. The system is developed using a combination of HTML, CSS for the front-end and PHP with MySQL for the back-end. It helps hostel administrators and staff to efficiently handle the various processes involved in hostel management.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Features</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Front-End:</strong> The application uses HTML and CSS to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. It is designed to be responsive, ensuring accessibility across devices with varying screen sizes.</li>
            <li><strong>Back-End:</strong> The back-end is built using PHP, which is responsible for handling data requests and processing operations such as room allocations, student registration, and payment tracking. MySQL is used for storing data such as student records, payment history, and room availability.</li>
            <li><strong>Document Management:</strong> One of the main features of the system is the ability to manage student documents and verify them digitally, reducing the time and manual effort involved in document processing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Achievements</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Efficiency Improvement:</strong> Achieved an 18% reduction in the time taken for document verification and update processes, improving overall operational efficiency in hostel management.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved User Experience:</strong> Designed and implemented a clean and intuitive user interface, making the system accessible and easy to use for administrators and users of all skill levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> The application was built with a mobile-first, responsive design approach, ensuring that users can access and interact with the system from a variety of devices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Technical Skills Used</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML:</strong> Markup language used for structuring the web pages and content.</li>
            <li><strong>CSS:</strong> Used for styling the application, including layouts, colors, typography, and responsiveness.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> For front-end functionality such as form validation and interactivity.</li>
            <li><strong>PHP:</strong> A server-side language used for back-end logic and handling database queries.</li>
            <li><strong>MySQL:</strong> Database system for storing and managing the data associated with the hostel management system.</li>
        </ul>
